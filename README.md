# Computational Science Rosetta Stone

This project is intended to provide examples (minimal working examples) of how to do common scientific tasks in code. 

The project could be viewed specifically as a **computational science** project, but is intended to cover the broadest array of **scientific** coding problems. Therefore, repositories and examples covering **all of the following are appropriate**:

+ Applied Mathematics
+ Computational Modeling
+ Computational Science
+ Data Science
+ Mathematical Modeling
+ Numerical Mathematics
+ Statistics

**and any other computational procedures in science generally**. For example, shell scripting code for managing data or coordinating other software would be more than welcome.

Currently all of the code appears in the project **Code Examples** and that will likely remain until there is enough code to require a reorganization into different projects under the main organization.

We welcome pull requests, feature requests, issues, and direct communications about the project (but especially pull requests!).
