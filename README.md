# Computational Science Rosetta Stone

## What is this all about?
This project is intended to provide examples (minimal working examples) of how to do common scientific tasks in code. It is intended to show how to do the same tasks **across** languages. Some rules for the code are listed below.

The project could be viewed specifically as a **computational science** project, but is intended to cover the broadest array of **scientific** coding problems. Therefore, repositories and examples covering **all of the following are appropriate**:

+ Applied Mathematics
+ Computational Modeling
+ Computational Science
+ Data Science
+ Mathematical Modeling
+ Numerical Mathematics
+ Statistics

**and any other computational procedures in science generally**. For example, shell scripting code for managing data or coordinating other software would be more than welcome. As would code related to generating automated reports as a part of the scientific research cycle.

Currently all of the code appears in the repo **Code Examples** and that will likely remain until there is enough code to require a reorganization into different projects under the main organization.

We welcome pull requests, feature requests, issues, and direct communications about the project (but especially pull requests!).

## Some Style Notes
The primary organization is by folder. Within a folder will be a `README.md` file that will specify the problem to be solved and use keywords to make searching easier. If the process is data based, there will be a `Data` subfolder. Please keep the directory structure as flat as possible. Use minimal data and make sure that the data is either artificial or legally can be shared. Please do not use data at other sites or data built-into software (for example, do not use the built in data sets in R!).

Unless there is compelling reason to do so, data shoule be in a universal format, such as `.csv`

Unless it is impossible, the code examples should be in single, complete files that use the usual extension for the example language. In principle, a person should be able to download the example file(s) and the `Data` directory to their local machine, and then either start the application (such as Matlab or SPSS) or open a command prompt in the directory
